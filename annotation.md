# annotation

Annotations are special tokens in GDScript that act as modifiers to a script or its code and may affect how the script is treated by the Godot engine or editor.

Every annotation starts with the @ character and is specified by a name.

`@export` is used to export the floowing declared variable, so it appears as a setting in the inspector.

`@onready` marks the following property as assigned when the Node is ready.
