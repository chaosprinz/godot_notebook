## Adding player node

- create scene from [[CharacterBody2d]]
- rename and save it
- add child-node for sprite (Sprite2d)
- drag the file to, or select the spritesheet in the "texture"-property of the sprite2d-node
- in the Animation-tab set Hframes to the number of horizontal frames in the spritesheet
- do the same for the vframes-setting, using the number of vertical frames in the spritesheet

## Setting up texture-filters

WeÂ´ll recognize that the sprite looks very blurry at this point. This comes from the linear texture-filter, which is used by default. Better suited for our needs is the "nearest" filter.

We have 2 options to set it up.

1. ### Locally, on the player-object
    - select the root-note of the player-object
    - in the inspector, under "Canvas items" -> "Textures", set the filter-property to "nearest"
2. ### Globally, in the project-settings
    - go to the menu, Project -> Project Settings
    - go to Rendering -> Textures
    - under "Canvas Textures", set "Default Texture Filter" to nearest.

We'll use option 2, so we dont need to the filter for every single object. 
    

## Viewport, scaling and window-size

### Viewport

When playing the scene at this point the player-object is so tiny
that it is almost invisble.

This is due to the fact that we didnt set the viewport. To set it:

- go to the menu Project -> Project Settings
- go to the window-tab
- set viewport width & height

### Scaling

Now the player-object should be visible, but it wont scale with 
the window-size. We need to stretch it with window-size like this:
  
- go to menu Project -> Project Settings
- go to window-tab
- under stretch, set mode to "canvas_items" and aspect to "keep"
  
### Window-size

When we run the szene now the player-object is visible and it 
scales with the window-size. 
Now we want to set the window-size without growing the viewport 
itself:

- go to mene Project -> Project Settings
- got to window-tab
- enable "advanced settings"
- under size, at the bottom, we set the window-width and window-height overrides.
